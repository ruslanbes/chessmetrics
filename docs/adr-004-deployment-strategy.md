# ADR-004: Deployment Strategy

## Status
Draft - Decision Pending

## Context
We need to choose a deployment strategy for the chessmetrics server that:
- Handles 100 requests per second efficiently
- Supports static file serving for cached FEN responses
- Provides high availability and reliability
- Scales appropriately with traffic growth
- Maintains cost-effectiveness
- Supports easy deployment and rollback procedures
- Works well with file system caching strategy

## Decision
**PENDING** - No decision made yet. Options under consideration:

## Options Under Consideration

### Option 1: Traditional VPS/Cloud Server
**Description**: Single server deployment on VPS or cloud instance (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, Linode)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full control over environment and configuration
- ✅ Simple deployment and maintenance
- ✅ Cost-effective for moderate traffic (100 req/sec)
- ✅ Easy static file serving setup
- ✅ Direct file system access for caching
- ✅ Simple backup and restore procedures
- ✅ No vendor lock-in

**Cons:**
- ❌ Single point of failure
- ❌ Manual scaling required
- ❌ More operational overhead
- ❌ Need to handle server maintenance and updates
- ❌ Limited horizontal scalability

**Cost Estimate**: $20-100/month depending on server specs

### Option 2: Docker + Kubernetes
**Description**: Containerized deployment with Kubernetes orchestration

**Pros:**
- ✅ Excellent horizontal scalability
- ✅ High availability with multiple replicas
- ✅ Container isolation and consistency
- ✅ Easy rollback and blue-green deployments
- ✅ Infrastructure as code
- ✅ Auto-scaling capabilities
- ✅ Load balancing across multiple instances

**Cons:**
- ❌ High complexity and learning curve
- ❌ Overkill for single service
- ❌ Higher operational costs
- ❌ Complex file system caching (needs shared storage)
- ❌ Requires Kubernetes expertise
- ❌ Additional infrastructure components

**Cost Estimate**: $200-500/month for managed Kubernetes

### Option 3: Serverless (AWS Lambda, Vercel, Netlify)
**Description**: Function-as-a-Service deployment

**Pros:**
- ✅ Automatic scaling
- ✅ Pay-per-request pricing
- ✅ No server management
- ✅ Built-in load balancing
- ✅ High availability

**Cons:**
- ❌ Cold start latency issues
- ❌ Limited execution time (15 minutes max)
- ❌ Complex for static file serving
- ❌ Vendor lock-in
- ❌ Difficult to implement file system caching
- ❌ No persistent storage between invocations

**Cost Estimate**: Variable based on usage, potentially expensive at scale

### Option 4: Platform as a Service (Heroku, Railway, Render)
**Description**: Managed platform deployment

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple deployment process
- ✅ Built-in scaling and load balancing
- ✅ Managed infrastructure
- ✅ Easy rollback procedures
- ✅ Good developer experience

**Cons:**
- ❌ Vendor lock-in
- ❌ Limited control over environment
- ❌ Potentially expensive at scale
- ❌ File system limitations (ephemeral storage)
- ❌ Less flexibility for custom configurations

**Cost Estimate**: $25-200/month depending on platform and usage

### Option 5: Hybrid Approach
**Description**: Combination of traditional server + CDN

**Pros:**
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ CDN for global distribution of cached files
- ✅ Server for dynamic processing
- ✅ Cost-effective scaling
- ✅ High performance

**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex architecture
- ❌ Multiple services to manage
- ❌ CDN costs for high traffic
- ❌ Cache invalidation complexity

**Cost Estimate**: $50-300/month depending on traffic

## Evaluation Criteria

### Performance Requirements:
- Handle 100 requests per second
- Low latency for cached responses
- Fast startup time

### Scalability Requirements:
- Easy horizontal scaling
- Handle traffic spikes
- Cost-effective scaling

### Operational Requirements:
- Simple deployment process
- Easy rollback procedures
- Minimal maintenance overhead
- Good monitoring and logging

### Cost Requirements:
- Cost-effective for expected traffic
- Predictable pricing
- No vendor lock-in preferred

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Traffic Growth**: What is the expected traffic growth over 6-12 months?
2. **Budget Constraints**: What is the acceptable monthly cost range?
3. **Team Expertise**: What is the team's experience with different deployment strategies?
4. **Availability Requirements**: What level of uptime is required?
5. **Geographic Distribution**: Do we need global distribution or single region?
6. **File System Caching**: How will we handle file system caching in distributed deployments?

## Next Steps

1. Gather requirements for traffic growth and budget
2. Evaluate team expertise and learning curve preferences
3. Test deployment options with proof-of-concept
4. Compare costs for expected traffic patterns
5. Make final decision based on evaluation criteria

## Implementation Notes (Pending Decision)

Once a deployment strategy is chosen, we will need to:
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Configure monitoring and logging
- Implement health checks
- Set up backup and disaster recovery
- Configure SSL/TLS certificates
- Implement proper security measures
